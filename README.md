# UnmappedSmallTownsOSM
A companion project to [SmallTownBot](https://en.osm.town/@SmallTownUSA) to help track places on OpenStreetMap that could use some more mapping. Each town will become an issue inside this tracker and folks are free to search through and find towns that they will enjoy mapping.

If you map a town or discover that at town has been mapped, please leave a comment!

So far this only contains towns in Georgia, USA. It can be expanded if there is interest. This is just a demonstration. Please reach out to [me](https://en.osm.town/@watmildon) with comments/suggestions/ideas. You can also find me on the OSM-US Slack and the Global OSM Discord.

# Mapping a town
Feel free to use any editor and map whatever interests you. The bot searches for places without buildings but there are lots and lots of other things that can be mapped from afar using aerial and street side imagery. Here's some ideas to get you started:

* buildings
* sidewalks
* natural areas (forest, farm land)
* waterways (streams, rivers
* street lights
* trees
* shops
* restaurants
* gas stations
* post offices
* ...
